            <p>This business does not actually exist. This fictional company serves as a hypothetical client for a web design course at Trinity University in San Antonio. There is an Essex Modern City <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/real-estate/article/150-million-mixed-use-development-coming-to-near-10973420.php">under construction</a>, but – sadly – there is not yet a Hacker Cafe. Many of the photos on this page are images of Seattle’s much beloved Bau Haus Cafe (RIP). Photos of musical performances and other live events are taken from the results of various image search requests conducted via Google. Menu content, vision statements, and other prose explanations are adapted from a variety of real-world businesses, with only minor modifications made to that content.</p>
